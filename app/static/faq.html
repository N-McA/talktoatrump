      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Why doesn't this work for me?</h3>
      <p>
        This site uses some advanced web technology to connect you directly to another person. Unfortunately it doesn't always work. You should try again on Firefox or Chrome, and perhaps wait a bit longer. (Also it was written in a couple of hours, so really we've no idea about edge case bugs.)
      </p>
      <h3>Why is this a thing?</h3>
      <p>
        Donald Trump has been elected president of the USA. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of divisive rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum. Hopefully this site will serve as a reminder that the people on both sides are just people.

      <h3>Why is there no texting?</h3>
      <p>
        <strike>Seeing a face is a better reminder of our common humanity.</strike> WebRTC video is fun.
