          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <h3>Why is this a thing?</h3>
					<p>
						It appears that Donald J Trump is going to be the president of the USA. Clearly I, nor anybody I know, has any idea how the world works. This is an attempt to figure it out by talking to people who voted.

          <h3>Why doesn't this work for me?</h3>
					<p>
						Because it sucks, your browser sucks, Trump sucks, oh god please kill me now.
